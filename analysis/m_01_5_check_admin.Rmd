# Introduction

These meta notebooks document the development of functions that will be
applied in the core pipeline.

The aim of the m_01 set of meta notebooks is to work out how to read the
raw entity data, drop excluded cases, discard irrelevant variables,
apply any cleaning, and construct standardised names. This does not
include construction of any modelling features. To be clear, the target
(`c_raw_entity_data`) corresponding to the objective of this set of
notebooks is the cleaned and standardised raw data, before constructing
any modelling features.

This notebook documents the checking the "administrative" variables for
any issues that need fixing.

The subsequent notebooks in this set will develop the other functions
needed to generate the cleaned and standardised data.

Regardless of whether there are any issues that need to be fixed, the
analyses here may inform our use of these variables in later analyses.

We don't know any of the details on how the NCVR data is collected and
processed, so our interpretations are only educated guesses. We have no
intention of using the administrative variables as predictors for entity
resolution. However, it's possible that they may shed some light on data
quality which might influence our choice of the records to be used for
modelling.

Define the "administrative" variables:

-   `county_id` - County identification number
-   `county_desc` - County description
-   `voter_reg_num` - Voter registration number (unique by county)
-   `ncid` - North Carolina identification number (NCID) of voter
-   `registr_dt` - Voter registration date
-   `cancellation_dt` - Cancellation date

```{r}
vars_admin <- c("county_id", "county_desc", "voter_reg_num", "ncid", "registr_dt", "cancellation_dt")  
```

# Read entity data

Read the raw entity data file using the previously defined core pipeline
functions `raw_entity_data_read()`, `raw_entity_data_excl_status()`,
`raw_entity_data_excl_test()`, `raw_entity_data_drop_novar()`, and
`raw_entity_data_parse_dates()`.

```{r, raw_entity_data_read, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r, raw_entity_data_excl_status, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r, raw_entity_data_excl_test, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r, raw_entity_data_drop_novar, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r, raw_entity_data_parse_dates, echo = FALSE}
```

```{r}
# Show the data file name
fs::path_file(f_entity_raw_tsv)

d <- raw_entity_data_read(f_entity_raw_tsv) %>% 
  raw_entity_data_excl_status() %>% 
  raw_entity_data_excl_test() %>% 
  raw_entity_data_drop_novar() %>% 
  raw_entity_data_parse_dates()

dim(d)
```

# county_id & county_desc

`county_id` - County identification number\
`county_desc` - County description

Look at a sample of values.

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::select(starts_with("county_")) %>% 
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 10) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = gt::cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = gt::cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>")
```

Look at `county_id`, a numeric code indicating a geographical area.

```{r}
# number of unique values
d$county_id %>% unique() %>% length()

# summary of distribution of county ID interpreted as a number
d$county_id %>% as.integer() %>% summary()

# number of records per county
d %>% 
  dplyr::count(county_id) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>") %>% 
  gt::fmt_number(columns = n, decimals = 0)

# plot the number of records per county
ggplot(d) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = forcats::fct_infreq(county_id))) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust=1, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

-   Never missing
-   Integer 1 .. 100 (as strings)
-   A small number of populous counties with a long tail of small
    counties

`county_desc` appears to be a text label corresponding to `county_desc`.
Check that the county descriptions are in a 1:1 relationship with the
county IDs.

```{r}
# number of unique values
d$county_desc %>% unique() %>% length()

# number of unique values of code:label combinations
paste(d$county_id, d$county_desc) %>% unique() %>% length()

# Is code:label a 1:1 relationship?
# Is the number of unique labels equal to the number of unique code:label combinations
(d$county_desc %>% unique() %>% length()) ==
  (paste(d$county_id, d$county_desc) %>% unique() %>% length())
```

-   100 unique values
-   `county_desc` in 1:1 relationship with `county_id`

They look reasonable, to the extent that I can tell without knowing
anything about the counties.

Because the variables are in a 1:1 relationship we don't need both of
them. I will drop the numeric `county_id` because knowing the county
name may be helpful when manually checking records against online
sources.

# voter_reg_num

`voter_reg_num` - Voter registration number (unique by county)

```{r}
# Show some examples from the beginning of the file
d %>% 
  dplyr::select(voter_reg_num) %>% 
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 10) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = gt::cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = gt::cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>")

# Show some examples from the end of the file
d %>% 
  dplyr::select(voter_reg_num) %>% 
  dplyr::slice_tail(n = 10) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = gt::cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = gt::cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>")

# number of unique values
d$voter_reg_num %>% unique() %>% length()

# summary of distribution of voter registration number interpreted as a number
d$voter_reg_num %>% as.integer() %>% summary()
```

-   \~2.3M unique values

    -   Much less than the number of rows, so the numbers are reused

-   Never missing

-   Integer 1 .. \~1,000M (as strings)

-   12-digit integers with leading zeroes

Check whether `county_id` $\times$ `voter_reg_num` is unique, as
claimed.

```{r}
# number of records
nrow(d)

# number of unique county_id x voter_reg_num combinations
paste(d$county_id, d$voter_reg_num) %>% unique() %>% length()

# Are the county_id x voter_reg_num combinations unique?
# Number of unique county_id x voter_reg_num combinations equals the number of rows?
nrow(d) ==
  (paste(d$county_id, d$voter_reg_num) %>% unique() %>% length())
```

-   `county_id` $\times$ `voter_reg_num` is unique, as claimed

# ncid

-   `ncid` - North Carolina identification number (NCID) of voter

Look at a sample of values.

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::select(ncid) %>% 
  dplyr::slice_sample(n = 10) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = gt::cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = gt::cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>")
```

The NCID is supposed to uniquely identify persons. Therefore, multiple
records with the same NCID should refer to the same person. I would
expect ACTIVE & VERIFIED records to refer to distinct people, because if
the state knew that two voter records corresponded to the same person I
would expect one of the records to be deleted.

Check whether NCID values are unique within the ACTIVE & VERIFIED
records.

```{r}
# number of records
n_rec <- nrow(d)
n_rec

# number of distinct NCID values
n_ncid <- d$ncid %>% unique() %>% length()
n_ncid

# check whether the NCIDs are unique
n_ncid == n_rec
```

-   There are a small number of records with the same NCID value

Look at the duplicated NCID values.

```{r}
# find the duplicated NCID values
d_dup <- d %>% 
  dplyr::select(ncid) %>% 
  dplyr::count(ncid) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(n > 1)

# get the distribution of duplication counts
table(d_dup$n)
```

-   38 NCID values occur in exactly two records each.

Look at records with the same NCID value.

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::inner_join(d_dup, by = "ncid") %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(ncid, registr_dt, last_name, first_name, midl_name, age) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(ncid) %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    ncid, last_name, first_name, midl_name, name_sufx_cd, 
    house_num, street_name, 
    sex, age, birth_place,
    registr_dt, county_id, voter_reg_num
  ) %>% 
  # dplyr::slice_sample(n = 10) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = gt::cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = gt::cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>")
```

    -   Not obvious why they have been assigned the same NCID

        -   BRENDA REYNOLDS NORMAN & BRENDA DIANNE TRANSOU

Interpretations:

-   The process is fallible

    -   E.g. counties are not coordinated with respect to change of
        address
    -   The database does not represent a single consistent view (there
        are multiple ACTIVE & VERIFIED records for the same person)
    -   Some obviously different records have been given the same NCID
    -   There are quite probably records corresponding to the same
        person that have not been assigned the same NCID

For the purposes of this project we want the database to only contain
unique persons, so we need to eliminate one of the records for NCIDs with two records.
Do this by choosing the record with the most recent registration date and if they both have the same registration date then chose the record with the higher voter registration number.

Define a function to remove the duplicate records.


```{r, raw_entity_data_exclude_dup_ncid}
```

Look at the number of records before and after applying the exclusion.

```{r}
# before
nrow(d)

# apply exclusion
x <- d %>% 
  raw_entity_data_exclude_dup_ncid()

# after
nrow(x)
```


# registr_dt

`registr_dt` - Voter registration date

```{r}
# summary of distribution of registration date interpreted as a date
d$registr_dt %>% summary()

# Get records apparently registered after the snapshot was taken (2005-11-25)
# The snapshot date is taken from earlier analyses before it was dropped
x <- d %>% 
  dplyr::filter(registr_dt > lubridate::ymd("2005-11-25")) # after snapshot date

# Number of records apparently registered after the snapshot was taken
nrow(x)

# Show records apparently registered after the snapshot was taken
x %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    registr_dt, county_desc, voter_reg_num, last_name, first_name, 
    street_name, street_type_cd, res_city_desc, age
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(county_desc, voter_reg_num) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::opt_row_striping() %>% 
  gt::tab_style(style = cell_text(weight = "bold"), locations = cells_column_labels()) %>% 
  gt::fmt_missing(columns = everything(), missing_text = "<NA>")
```

-   Never missing

-   18 records have registration date after the snapshot date

    -   Range from a couple of years to millennia in the future
    -   Presumably these are typos

-   Some records have very early registration dates

-   There is nothing obviously odd about the cases with registration
    date after the snapshot date. The problem is proibabably just in the
    registration date.

Investigate the early registration dates.

First form a view on how early is too early by finding the maximum age
and assuming registration at 21 years of age.

```{r}
# summary of distribution of age interpreted as an integer
d$age %>% as.integer() %>% summary()

# get some extreme quantiles of the age distribution
d$age %>% as.integer() %>% quantile(probs = c(0.003, 0.004, 0.995, 0.996, 0.997, 0.998, 0.999))

# plot the distribution of age <= 21
d %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(age = as.integer(age)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(age <= 21) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 18, colour = "red") +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age), binwidth = 1) +
  scale_y_log10()

# plot the distribution of age >= 80
d %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(age = as.integer(age)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(age >= 80) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(105, 125, 204), colour = "red") +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = age), binwidth = 1) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

-   Age 18 seems to be the generally youngest age, but some are
    registered at 17, which seems plausible.

-   The only younger people have an age of 0 or 8 years. These are
    obviously wrong.

-   The distribution of ages 80+ opened a can of worms. There are
    obviously some issues with `age`. I will deal with that in detail in
    a later notebook.

Without considering `age` in detail, it appears that the maximum
accurate age is not more than 120 years.

Assume that the maximum possible voter age is 116 years. The minimum
registration age in North Carolina is 16 years (although I have no idea
what it was 100 years ago). Therefore, assume that the oldest possible
voter could have registered 100 years prior to the snapshot date. That
is, regard any registration earlier than 1905-11-25 as very unlikely to
be correct.

Now look at the distribution of registration dates that are no later
than the snapshot date.

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::filter(registr_dt <= lubridate::ymd("2005-11-25")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(lubridate::ymd("1905-11-25"), lubridate::ymd("1935-11-25")),
             colour = "red") +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = registr_dt), binwidth = 365.25) + # 1yr bins
  scale_y_sqrt()
```

-   There is a large spike of registrations in 1900. These are bound to
    be errors. (1900 is a common default value for year.)

-   Registration dates before \~1935 are suspect (because the
    distribution of probably accurate dates appears to run out around

    1935) 

Look at the relationship between age and registration date. The vast
majority of these records will be OK, so spreading the observations over
two dimensions may make it easier to spot anomalous regions.

First look at all the records (excluding those with registration date
after the snapshot date).

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(age = as.integer(age)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(registr_dt <= lubridate::ymd("2005-11-25")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_hex(aes(x = age, y = registr_dt, fill = stat(log10(count))), binwidth = c(1, 365.25)) # 1yr bins x&y
```

The heavily populated triangular region contains most of the cases and
shows the (mostly) plausible combinations of registration date and age
at snapshot date.

Now exclude the manifestly unlikely ages (\< 17 or \> 104 years).

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(age = as.integer(age)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(
    dplyr::between(registr_dt, lubridate::ymd("1901-01-01"), lubridate::ymd("2005-11-25")),
    dplyr::between(age, 17, 104)
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_hex(aes(x = age, y = registr_dt, fill = stat(log10(count))), binwidth = c(1, 365.25)) # 1yr bins x&y
```

-   The blue'ish upper triangle corresponds to people who were at least
    18 years old at registration.

-   The black fringe below the blue-ish upper triangle corresponds to
    people who were less that 18 years old at registration.

-   The negative diagonal line corresponds to people who would have been
    zero years old at registration.

-   The points below the negative diagonal line correspond to people who
    appear to have been registered before they were born.

-   Most registration dates are consistent with age

-   A significant fraction of registration dates are *inconsistent* with
    age.

There appear to be a nontrivial number of age and registration date
combinations that are implausible. These are most likely due to typos in
those variables.

-   The implausible combinations are only a small fraction of the total
    records.
-   We are not intending to use age or registration date in the models,
    so the oddities are probably not an issue. However, it does indicate
    that we don't want to treat this data as though it is perfectly
    accurate.
-   Drop `registr_dt` because it won't be used in modelling and it can
    not be checked against any external data source.

# cancellation_dt

`cancellation_dt` - Cancellation date

```{r}
# summary of distribution of cancellation date interpreted as a date
d$cancellation_dt %>% summary()

# look at the fraction of missing values
table(missing = is.na(d$cancellation_dt))
table(missing = is.na(d$cancellation_dt)) %>% prop.table() %>% round(3)

# plot the distribution of nonmissing cancellation date
d %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(cancellation_dt)) %>% # not missing
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = cancellation_dt), binwidth = 7) + # 1wk bins
  scale_y_sqrt()
```

-   Cancellation date is almost always missing

    -   `r nrow(x)` (`r round(100*nrow(x)/nrow(d), 1)`%) nonmissing

-   Concentrated in 1996 and early 1997 (presumably some sort of
    administrative purge)

It is not clear what having a cancellation date means for records that
are flagged as ACTIVE & VERIFIED. Perhaps they had been removed from the
electoral roll in the past and subsequently reinstated.

-   Drop the cancellation date because of the high proportion of missing
    values, we won't use it in modelling, and it can't be checked
    against any external data source.

# Drop unneeded variables

Drop `county_id`, `registr_dt`, and `cancellation_dt`.

```{r, raw_entity_data_drop_admin}
```

Apply the filter and track the number of rows before and after the
filter.

```{r}
# number of columns before dropping
d %>% 
  names() %>% length

d %>% 
  raw_entity_data_drop_admin() %>% 
  # number of columns after dropping
  names() %>% length
```

# Timing {.unnumbered}

```{r echo=FALSE}
tictoc::toc()
```
