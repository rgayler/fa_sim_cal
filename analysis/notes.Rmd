This document is for keeping notes of any points that may be useful for
later project or manuscript development and which are not covered in the
analysis notebooks or at risk of getting lost in the notebooks.

# Project infrastructure

-   Consider using the [targets](https://wlandau.github.io/targets/)
    package to control the computational workflow.

# Identity data

-   Get a sizeable publicly available data set with personal names
    (NCVR).

    -   The focus of the empirical work is on string similarity metrics
        of names.

-   Use sex and age in addition to personal names so that most records
    are discriminable.

    -   High frequency names will likely not be discriminable with only
        these attributes.

        -   This is not a problem because we are really interested in
            whether the methods proposed here assist in quantifying the
            discriminability of records. We want records spanning a wide
            range of discriminability.

    -   Age (and possibly sex) will be used as a blocking variable.

        -   Blocking is probably needed to make the project
            computationally tractable.

    -   Age and sex are also of interest in the calculation of name
        frequency because name distributions should vary conditional on
        age and sex.

-   Keep address and phone number as they may be useful for manually
    checking identity in otherwise nondiscriminable records.

    -   As a fallback position, address and phone number can be used as
        discriminating attributes in the compatibility model.

-   Get the oldest available data to minimise it's currency (NCVR 2005
    snapshot).

-   Drop objectionable attributes such as race and political
    affiliation.

# Identity data preparation

-   Apply basic data cleaning to the predictive attributes.

    -   This is probably unnecessary given how the data will be used.

    -   I can't bring myself to model data without scrutinising it
        first.

-   Only keep records that are ACTIVE and VERIFIED for modelling.

    -   These are likely to have the highest data quality attributes.

    -   These are least likely to have duplicate records (i.e. referring
        to the same person).

# Identity data characterisation

-   Look at frequency distributions of names conditional on name length.
    The Zipf distributions may have different shape parameters for
    different name lengths. Name length might be examined as an
    alternative to name frequency for interaction with similarity.

-   Look at frequency distributions of names conditional on age and/or
    sex

    -   These conditional distributions may increase the predictive
        power of the compatibility model.

# Blocking

-   Use blocking to reduce the number of comparisons, to keep the
    computational cost feasible.

-   This project is not an operational system and we are only using
    blocking to reduce the computational cost, so we can choose blocking
    that would not be acceptable for an operational system.

-   Where the dictionary blocks vary widely in size we might choose to
    work with only a subset of blocks that are a suitable size.

-   If we think that the some aspect of the compatibility modelling
    might vary as a function of block size we would probably want to
    test this over a wide range of block sizes.

-   We will probably be repeating analyses over some number of blocks to
    assess the variability of results, but that might only be a subset
    of blocks with no commitment to examine *all* the blocks.

-   Blocking can induce changes in the distributions of names.

    -   Blocking on sex (in combination with other variables) will
        definitely give more homogeneity of first names within blocks
        because of gendered names.

    -   Blocking on age will give more homogeneity of first names within
        blocks because of name popularity varying over time.

    -   Blocking on county *may* give more homogeneity of last names
        within blocks because of families living together.

# Modelling

-   Try indicators for missingness. Missingness may be differentially
    informative across different predictor variables.

-   Try indicators for similarity == 1. The compatibility of exact
    string equality is not necessarily continuous with the compatibility
    of similarity just below 1.

-   Try name frequency as an interactive predictor variable.

    -   Also consider frequency conditional on age and/or sex

-   There are *two* names in each lookup: dictionary and query.
    Therefore there are also two name frequencies to be considered.
    Consider how to use *both* frequencies (e.g. min, max, geometric
    mean, ...).

    -   Queries may contain names that do not exist in the dictionary,
        so we need to deal with that case.

    -   Do we need to apply frequency smoothing, as used in
        probabilistic linguistic models?

    -   Do we need to estimate the probability mass of unobserved names?

-   In general, the dictionary will be a subset of the entities in the
    universe of queries. Consider the impact of this on modelling as the
    fraction of the query universe in the dictionary varies.

    -   Consider whether this varies on a per query basis because of
        blocking. That is, is there effectively a separate dictionary
        per blocking value?
    -   Can the sampling fraction be modelled as a prior probability
        (effectively, a change in the intercept term of a logistic
        regression)?
    -   Consider using the same variable for blocking and as a predictor
        to compare the effect on estimated probability of identity match
        as a function of dictionary fraction.

# Performance evaluation

-   Partition the records into a dictionary and a set of queries (the
    $Q_U$ set).

    -   By the (reasonable) assumption that there are no duplicate
        records, each of the $Q_U$ queries will be unmatched in the
        dictionary.

-   Select a subset of the dictionary records to use as the $Q_M$ query
    set.

    -   By the (reasonable) assumption that there are no duplicate
        records, each of the $Q_M$ queries will have exactly one
        matching record in the dictionary.

-   This is evaluation is different to the usual evaluation of entity
    resolution in that it doesn't consider the impact of
    transcription/typographical variation in the queries.

    -   It looks at the quantification of discriminability when the
        available attributes are not necessarily able to ensure that all
        records are discriminable.

-   If we are interested in the performance with respect to
    transcription/typographical variation we may need to consider
    artificially corrupting some of the queries.

# Writing/theory

-   Note relationship to Fellegi & Sunter / probabilistic record linkage
    (in proposal?)

## Blocking

-   It might be possible to develop (or at least explain) most of the
    maths in terms of blocking.

-   Start with a universe $E$ of entities with the queries drawn
    uniformly at random from that universe and the dictionary being
    identical to the universe.

-   In the absence of any other information, the probability of each
    dictionary element being an identity match with the query is \$ 1 /
    \|E\| \$.

-   If the dictionary $D$ is a proper subset of $E$ it can be thought of
    as a (not very informative) block. That is, a block can be thought
    of as the dictionary induced by the query record.

-   If $D$ is a random subset of $E$, and in the absence of any other
    information, the probability of each dictionary element being an
    identity match with the query is $(|D| / |E|) / |D| = 1 / |E|$.

-   $|D|$ is the block size of the dictionary construed as a block. In
    the absence of any information to discriminate between records in
    the block, the larger the block, the lower the probability the any
    block record is the identity match to the query record.

-   $|D| / |E|$ is the probability that the entity corresponding to the
    query record is in the dictionary/block, given that the dictionary
    is a uniform random subset of the universe of entities.

-   Consider the other extreme, where blocking is perfect. That is, the
    entity query record is guaranteed to be in the dictionary. In this
    case the blocking is very informative (not a random selection from
    the universe of entities). The probability that the correctly
    matching entity record is in the block is 1, and the probability of
    each dictionary/block element being an identity match with the query
    is $1 / |D|$.

    -   That is, with perfect blocking, the probability of each entity
        being the identity match depends only on the block size.

    -   Where blocking is based on, say, name, the block size is the
        frequency of the name in the dictionary.

    -   Where blocking is less then perfect the probability that the
        entity corresponding to the query record is contained in the
        block will be less than 1.

-   This suggests that the probability of each record in the block being
    the correct match could be calculated as the product of conditional
    probabilities:

    $$ P(id(q) = id(d_i)) = P(id(q) = id(d_i) | d_i \in B_j) P(d_i \in B_j | d_i \in D)  P(d_i \in D) $$

-   What we need are models to estimate those component probabilities. I
    suspect that the cardinalities of those blocks would be very strong
    predictors of the probabilities. If the blocks are defined in terms
    of equality of names then the name frequencies determine the block
    cardinalities.

-   If there were multiple independent blockings, the probability of
    correct match of each record in the intersection of the blocks id
    the product of the probabilities associated with each block. This is
    equivalent to naive Bayes and shows the equivalence between
    construing the problem as a multivariate regression and construing
    it as using multiple blocking variables.

    -   Using regression rather than naive Bayes allows compensating for
        the blocking variables not being independent.
