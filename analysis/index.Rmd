This is the website for the research project "Frequency-Aware Similarity Calibration".

If you have cloned the project to a local computer this website is rendered in the `docs` subdirectory of the project directory.

If you are using `workflowr` to publish the research website it will also be rendered online to GitHub Pages.

This page acts as a table of contents for the website. There are links to the webpages generated from the analysis notebooks and to the rendered versions of manuscripts/documents/presentations.

## [Proposal](proposal.html) {.unnumbered}

This notebook explains the central ideas behind the project.

## [Notes](notes.html) {.unnumbered}

This notebook is for keeping notes of any points that may be useful for later project or manuscript development and which are not covered in the analysis notebooks or at risk of getting lost in the notebooks.

## 01 Read, check, and standardise the entity data {.unnumbered}

Initial data preparation of imported entity records.

### [01-1 Get, subset, check, and save data](01-1_get_data.html) {.unnumbered}
