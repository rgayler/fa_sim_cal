This is the website for the research project "Frequency-Aware Similarity Calibration".

If you have cloned the project to a local computer this website is rendered in the `docs` subdirectory of the project directory.

If you are using `workflowr` to publish the research website it will also be rendered online to GitHub Pages.

This page acts as a table of contents for the website. There are links to the webpages generated from the analysis notebooks and to the rendered versions of manuscripts/documents/presentations.

## [Proposal](proposal.html) {.unnumbered}

This notebook explains the central ideas behind the project.

## [Notes](notes.html) {.unnumbered}

This notebook is for keeping notes of any points that may be useful for later project or manuscript development and which are not covered in the analysis notebooks or at risk of getting lost in the notebooks.

# Analysis Notebooks {.unnumbered}

## 01 Read, check, and standardise the entity data {-}

Initial data preparation of imported entity records.

### [01-1 Get, subset, check, and save data](01-1_get_data.html) {.unnumbered}

Import the raw data, cut it back to the subset of rows and columns that are possibly useful, sanity check the data, and save the data in an R-friendly format.

### [01-2 Check administrative variables](01-2_check_admin.html) {.unnumbered}

Check the "administrative" variables. This is data relating to the administration of voter registration.

### [01-3 Check residence variables](01-3_check_resid.html) {.unnumbered}

Check the residence variables - residential address and phone number.

### [01-4 Check demographic variables](01-4_check_demog.html) {.unnumbered}

Check the demographic variables - sex, age, and birth place.

### [01-5 Check name variables](01-5_check_name.html) {.unnumbered}

Check the name variables.

## 02 Name frequency {-}

Detailed examination of the distributions of name frequencies.


## 03 Similarity calibration {-}

Detailed examination of the calibration from similarity to probability of identity match,
both unconditionally and as a function of name frequency.



## 03 Compatibility models {-}

Estimate multivariate compatibility models.
