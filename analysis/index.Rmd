This is the website for the research project "Frequency-Aware Similarity Calibration".

If you have cloned the project to a local computer
this website is rendered in the `docs` subdirectory of the project directory.

If you are using `workflowr` to publish the research website
it will also be rendered online to GitHub Pages.

This page acts as a table of contents for the website.
There are links to the webpages generated from the analysis notebooks
and to the rendered versions of manuscripts/documents/presentations.
