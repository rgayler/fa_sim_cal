# Manuscripts

Store manuscripts here, in one directory per manuscript.
Use a package like *bookdown* or *rticles* to create the manuscript.
For example, use the Rstudio 'New R markdown' dialog to start the manuscript from an *rticles* template.
This will create the directory for the manuscript and populate it with relevant files.

Symlink the manuscript output file into the docs directory
so it will be available to the GitHub website generated by workflowr.
