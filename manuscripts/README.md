# Manuscripts

Store manuscripts here, in one directory per manuscript.

Use a package like *bookdown* or *rticles* to create the manuscript.
For example, use the Rstudio 'New R markdown' dialog to start the manuscript from an *rticles* template.
This will create the directory for the manuscript and populate it with relevant files.

Symlink the manuscript output file into the `docs` directory
so it will be available to the GitHub website generated by workflowr.
The file *must* be in the `docs` directory
and the symlink in the subdirectory of `manuscripts`.
