# Docs

Most files here are the website pages generated by [`workflowr`][wf].

Rendered manuscript files are also stored here.
They are not maintained by [`workflowr`][wf].
They are updated via a symlink in the relevant subdirectory of `manuscripts`.
The file *must* stored in `docs`
so that the GitHub website can access it.
